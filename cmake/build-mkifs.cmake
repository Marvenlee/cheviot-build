# Build the mkifs tool in order to generate the kernel.img which
# comprises of the bootloader and read-only Initial File System (IFS)
# concatenated together.
#
# The IFS contains a simple filesystem containing the kernel and
# the required drivers in order to bootstrap the system.  These include:
#
# kernel
# ifs filesystem handler (acts as root and IFS handler)
# aux uart driver
# init and startup.cfg (runs simple init script)
# dev filesystem for /dev mount
# sdcard driver
# ext2 filesystem handler
#
# Optionally this can contain the ksh shell and other command line utilities
